# Taylor's Calculator üßÆ

## About This Project

I first fell in love with computers when I was growing up in a developing country.  
Because of my dyslexia, people around me often labeled me as lazy or stupid ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt believe in learning differences. But I knew better.

It all started with a simple calculator. That small machine made me realize something magical: **computers do exactly what you tell them to do.** That spark never went away.

Over the years, I became the family ‚Äúcomputer expert‚Äù ‚Äî even when I didn‚Äôt plan to. I taught myself coding, problem-solving, and how computers think.

Recently, I was diagnosed with **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**. Just like with my PTSD and dyslexia, some people doubted me again. But if MS has taken anything from me, it hasn‚Äôt taken my **love for learning** or my **drive to create**.

This calculator is one of many projects I‚Äôve always wanted to build ‚Äî a reminder that starting small is still starting.  
And what better language to begin with than **Python**?
